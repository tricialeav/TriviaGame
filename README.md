# TriviaGame

In this game, the player will be presented with a trivia question, along with a selection of four possible answers. The player will have a total of 10 seconds to make a guess (marked either correct or incorrect) before the answer is automatically marked as "incorrect" and the game moves to the next round. Player will be presented with "play again" option at the end of the question list, which restarts the game without requiring browser reload.
